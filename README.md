# Bank-Credit-Score-Prediction

This project's primary objective is to forecast individuals' bank credit scores by employing a range of machine learning classification algorithms. 
These algorithms include Logistic Regression, DecisionTreeClassifier and RandomForestClassifier. The project workflow encompasses several key steps:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis: Initial analysis of the dataset to gain insights and understanding of the data's characteristics.

2. Data Preprocessing: This involves preparing the data for modeling. Categorical variables are encoded using LabelEncoding to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms.

3. Model Building: Development of predictive models using the prepared dataset and the chosen classification algorithms.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimization of model parameters to enhance predictive accuracy and performance.

5. Model Evaluation: Assessment of model performance through various metrics such as confusion matrices, classification reports, and ROC curves. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of how well the models are performing.

6. Predictions: Utilization of the trained models to make predictions on new data, allowing for the assessment of their real-world applicability.

->>The RandomForestClassifier achieved the best test accuracy (88.95%).

As part of future work, we plan to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to facilitate the easy prediction of bank credit scores. This GUI will make the model more accessible and user-friendly, potentially benefiting both financial institutions and individuals seeking credit scores.
